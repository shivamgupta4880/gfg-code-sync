## Problem Statement
You are given **n** disks placed on a starting rod (from), with the smallest disk on top and the largest at the bottom. There are three rods: the **starting** rod(from), the **target** rod (to), and an **auxiliary **rod (aux).
You have to calculate the minimum number of moves required to transfer all **n** disks from the starting rod to the target rod, following these rules:
      1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
     ** **2.** **A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty rod.
Return the **minimum **number of moves needed to complete the task.

**Examples:**

```
**Input: **n = 2
**Output: **3
Explanation: For n = 2, total 3 steps will be taken. Steps are as follows -
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 2
move disk 2 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 2 to rod 3

```

```
**Input: **n = 3
**Output: **7
Explanation: For n = 3, total 7 steps will be taken.Steps are as follows -
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 2 from rod 1 to rod 2
move disk 1 from rod 3 to rod 2
move disk 3 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 2 to rod 1
move disk 2 from rod 2 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 3

```

```
**Input: **n = 0
**Output: **0
Explanation: Total 0 steps will be taken.
```
